        <h1>What is this?</h1><br>
        After 3 years of study at the University of Exeter, I successfully completed my degree in Mathematics BSc and was eagar to begin exploring new aveneus to begin a career in software development. 
        I have experience in many programming languages, but I wanted to be able to show my abilities as well as continue learning. 
        Thus, I began working on projects such as this webpage, to improve my programming skills and also detail my university education.
        My aim was to produce a website that was interactive and also worked on other media like mobile phones to help me improve my Css, HTML and Javascript coding abilities.
        This was the result.

              <h3>Groups, Rings and Fields</h3> 
              This module explored some of the key techniques of modern algebra, including groups, rings, and fields. 
              These topics have their roots in the desire to solve certain equations that arise from arithmetic and geometry. 
              I tackled problems in many branches of mathematics that require the use of groups, rings and fields and revealed
              sufficient knowledge of the fundamental algebraic concepts needed for advanced studies in pure mathematics. 
              This enabled me to fully appreciate that concrete problems often require abstract theories for their solution.
              Furthermore, I was able to extend my ability to monitor my own progress, to manage time, and to formulate and solve complex problems.
              <br><br>
              In summary, this module explored the following topics:<br><br>
              <ul>

            <li class="slide">
              <h3>Linear Algebra</h3> 
              This module extended my knowledge from ‘Groups, Rings, and Fields’ and focused on linear transformations between vector spaces.
              A core objective was to understand the relationship between linear maps and matrices, and how the properties of each influence the solvability of systems of linear equations.
              My studies focused on problems in many branches of mathematics that are linearisable, using the core skills of solving linear systems.
              In addition, I followed algorithms for solving linear equations and finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors in rigorous and formal terms.
              <br><br>
              In summary, this module explored the following topics:<br><br>
              <ul>
                <li>Vector spaces and subspaces.</li><br>
                <li>Linear combinations, linear transformations and linear independence.</li><br>

                <h3>Analysis</h3> 
                Building on the material from the first year, my study of mathematical analysis developed my understanding of mathematics in the context of real and complex variables. 
                The key focus of this module is on infinite processes that can appear naturally, from science and engineering to economics.  
                In particular I developed skills to rigorously handle real-variable differentiation, Riemann integration, analyticity, contour integration, power series, and the basic notions of topology.
                I was also able to improve my ability to think analytically and use logical argument and deduction.
                Furthermore, the material I encountered provided a foundation in my studies of differential equations as well third year modules including geometry/topology, number theory and integral equations.
                <br><br>
                In summary, this module explored the following topics:<br><br>
                <ul>
                  <li>Topology on the real and complex set of numbers.</li><br>

              </li>
            </li>
            <li class="slide">
              <h3>Differential Equations</h3> 
              The basis of this module is formed on the knowledge that in mathematics all rates of change and acceleration can be described by derivative functions. 
              These include the growth of populations, the spread of diseases, movement of physical objects in response to forces acting on them, or even the fluctuations of the stock market.
              These were just some applications I applied my learning to as I discovered and utilised the basic principles of differential equations.
              In particular I developed methods to solve the wave and heat equations which are fundamental to modelling many physical processes. 
              <br><br>
              In summary, this module explored the following topics:<br><br>

            </li>
            <li class="slide">
              <h3>Vector Calculus and Applications</h3> 
              This module introduced me to vector calculus and its applications, which are fluid dynamics and electromagnetism.
                By the end of my studies I was as able to carry out manipulations with vector calculus in both differential and integral forms (line, surface and volume integrals).
                I also illustrated the application of vector calculus to particular problems in fluid mechanics and electromagnetism.
                This extended my experience in devising and formulating solutions to complex problems and furthered my understanding of how closely related calculus can be to real life problems.
                <br><br>
                In summary, this module explored the following topics:<br><br>

                <h3>Statistical Modelling and Inference</h3>
                This area of study focused on statistical inference, which is the way that we use data and other information to learn about and apply statistical models.
                I learnt the theory underpinning modern statistical methods such as fitting normal linear models and evaluating how well they fit the data and taking inferences from it.
                I continued my learning of the statistical software R to analyse and draw conclusions from a range of real-world data sets. 
                Furthermore, I developed my time management and communication skills whilst working in a team to formulate a real experiment, record data and apply statistical models.
                Following this I documented my results, demonstrating general data analysis skills and communication associated reasoning.

                <h4>CONTEXT:</h4>
                This was an investigative module where I selected a topic about cloud computing and was tasked with conducting research to produce a document with my findings 
                and a recomendation for the University. 
                I was able to collaborate with other students and finally had to opportunity to present our findings to a group of clients, lecturers and students.
                As a team of eight, we focused on how cloud computing resources can be used to improve the quality of education at the University of Exeter.
                We ran surveys with both CEMPS students and staff members to understand the University’s needs. We also looked into and trialled cloud services, 
                including Microsoft Teams, GitLab and Azure Lab Services.
                In order to give a well rounded recommendation we also researched the costs of these services and compared this to the University’s present outlays.

                <h4>MY RESPONSIBILITIES:</h4> 
                Throughout the project I ran the trial group aimed at obtaining experience feedback from students who had just used Azure Lab Services. For this I acquired an active license from the IT team, set up the classroom lab containing virtual machines specifically designed for our task, created effective question sheets on coding, organised a number of students in a suitable computer lab to carry out the test.
                In addition, I managed the section on Microsoft Teams, acquiring the active license from IT team and running communications when an issue occurred.
                Another responsibility I had was managing the output of the report, including all the Microsoft Teams and Azure lab services sections as well as the conclusion, editing and proof reading.
                I also contributed by organising meetings and delivered an update presentation in front of an audience, aimed to inform interested parties.

              Number theory is a vast and fascinating field of mathematics, consisting of the study of the properties of whole numbers.
              This module was aimed at aquiring working knowledge of the main concepts of classical elementary number theory. 
              Throughout my lectures I learnt rigorous proof-based theory along with some of the theory behind modern computational techniques.<br><br>
              Topics studied include divisibility properties of natural numbers, congruences, prime numbers, primality and factorisation, 
              quadratic reciprocity, sums of squares and Fermat’s last theorem for the special case of sums of fourth powers.
              Covering one of the oldest and most popular areas of mathematics, this module built on basic ideas, 
              provided modern answers to ancient problems and modern applications of classical ideas.

              Graphs are viewed as a structure used to describe the underlying connectedness of a system. Therefore, it has
              a vast range of applications from designing circuits to running a business efficiently. 
              In this module, I studied the theory of graphs and explored their practical application whilst solving a range of mathematical problems and applying them to real situations.
              Moreover, I was tasked with analysing the effectiveness and computational complexity of algorithms, learning how to refine my proposed methods to optimise their performance.
              Additionally there was a practical component to the module where I had to successfully integrate algorithms under timed conditions to solve problems such as the route inspection and maximum flow problem<br><br>
              This module also contained an investigative section where I researched epidemiology, which is a very relevant topic today.

              At its core, cryptography is the mathematical science of maintaining information security. 
              In this module, I learnt and followed practical algorithms for encrypting plain messages into secret messages.
              These algorithms ranged from the simple ciphers used in ancient Rome to the sophisticated modern ciphers 
              that secure worldwide banking transactions and diplomatic communications.<br><br>

              Whilst studying two cryptosystems: symmetric and asymmetric, 
              I also learnt ways to apply the principles of block ciphers with particular examples including the Vigenère, affine, and Hill cipher.
              The aim of this module was to apply number theory, linear algebra, and field theory to problems in the real world where 
              it is important to transmit information securely. 
              Python and Jupyter notebook was also used to perform complex computations that envolved encrypting or decrypting.

              In this module, I had the opportunity to study mathematical topics involving geometry, topology, 
              and their applications in science and technology. I first became familiar with the mathematical 
              description of curves and surfaces, and the idea of topological equivalence. 
              Then I learnt about knot theory, braid theory, the classification of surfaces, and the shape of 
              bubbles. Following this I dived into the applications of geometry and toplogy, including the 
              geometry of DNA molecules, the shape of the universe, and the topology of magnetic fields.<br><br>
              The module involved opportunities to learn about current cosmological speculations concerning the shape of the universe,
